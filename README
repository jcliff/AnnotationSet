Instructions on compiling & running: 

TESTSUITE:
	Compilation	: make testsuite
	Usage		: ./testsuite [A2C snapshot file] [optional: "BTreeFile"]
	
PROFILER
	Compilation	: make profiler
	Usage		: ./profiler [A2C snapshot file] [optional: "BTreeFile"]		

Notes:
	BTreeFile is tree-like data-structure that complements HashFile.  By including
	it in the command-line, we can either verify its correctness or test
	it's speed versus the standard binary-search implementation that HashFile implements.
